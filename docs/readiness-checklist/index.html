            <h1>Onboarding Readiness Checklist</h1>

<p>Is your team ready for onboarding to ServiceNow? Read through this checklist to see what's needed and how to prepare it.</p>

<h2>Commitment and Priority</h2>

<p>Onboarding to ServiceNow is a significant undertaking for your team. You have to commit to the process and hold it as a priority - which means devoting time and focus to every step.</p>

<p>It may be that you cannot sustain business-as-usual and participate fully in all the development activities - you may need to secure and allocate additional resources, which may require higher-level approvals (such as through the Project Portfolio Board).</p>

<h2>Existing and Planned Processes Documented</h2>

<h3>What</h3>

<p>There are as many ways to document processes as processes. While a shareable document is essential, it need not be an exhaustive manual or a stack of BPMN diagrams (though it <em>can</em> be those).</p>

<p>What's crucial for onboarding to ServiceNow is that you've arrived at consensus with your whole team on:</p>

<ol>
<li>What the details of your <em>current</em> process are</li>
<li>What works.</li>
<li>What needs improvement</li>
</ol>

<p>You'll need some way of conveying that to anyone who might come along.</p>

<h3>Why</h3>

<p>Without agreement on the difference between what is and what should be your process - you'll spend your development effort trying to clarify a collective vision, rather than realizing it.</p>

<p>Adopting ServiceNow is not a "lift and shift" exercise of reproducing your existing process in a new system - but understanding what your current practice looks like is crucial to planning for how to adapt and improve it.</p>

<p>You need to write it down for three reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>Ensuring the consensus is real - everyone on the team must affirmatively commit to the document before moving forward.</li>
<li>Sharing with others - transparency, accountability and collective learning are all good reason to work out in the open, we share our work products with others to reduce duplication.</li>
<li>Falsification - agile development is about testing hypotheses, your process map is your first hypothesis to test.</li>
</ol>

<h3>How</h3>

<p>There are many ways to document your process, and typically the best way is whichever way you can do right now. A good technique is to do cross-checks. Each team member documents their view of a shared process individually to the best of their knowledge, without consulting with others. Then, these are shared out and the team collectively collates them into a single snapshot of current practice.</p>

<p>Documenting the rationale for each component of a process is also critical.</p>

<p>Here are some resources on process mapping and service design:</p>

<h2>Business Case Written</h2>

<h3>What</h3>

<p>Mapping your process should give you a clear picture of risks and challenges. Now you can articulate a business case for what ServiceNow can do for you. You shouldn't do this in isolation - please reach out to the ServiceNow team for guidance.</p>

<p>The business case should articulate what processes your team wants to implement in ServiceNow, how much effort that is likely to take (from your team, and the ServiceNow team), and what sort of value is realized.</p>

<p>You should ensure that your business case aligns with our Divisional business plan.</p>

<h3>Why</h3>

<p>Developing solutions for ServiceNow is costly, sustaining those solutions and retaining licenses for users is also costly. At minimum, we must ensure the value of onboarding to ServiceNow indefinitely exceeds the cost of doing so.</p>

<p>The business case is necessary to justify the allocation of resources to your project.</p>

<h3>How</h3>

<p>[Talk to the DPMO to get best wording here]</p>

<h2>Subject Matter Expert Designated</h2>

<h3>What</h3>

<p>Agile development operates on certain assumptions about how a team is structured. One of those is the constant availability of a subject matter expert to the development team. This person must be available to answer any questions regarding the business area, either themselves or by seeking the answer with their own team.</p>

<p>Your team must supply this subject matter expert. It is unlikely they can sustain their ordinary workload while also acting as a subjec matter expert - contact is frequent (daily or more) and often intensive (face-to-face interaction is the norm). Time demands can be estimated on a sprint-by-sprint basis, but it is reasonable to expect between 25% and 75% time allocation.</p>

<h3>Why</h3>

<p>The slower and less frequent the communication between business and development, the longer and riskier a software development initiative becomes. Uncertainty about who to contact or their availability causes confusion and duplication of effort.</p>

<h3>How</h3>

<p>The subject matter expert need not be the highest ranked or most senior member of the team. They do not make decisions unilaterally but are a touch point for collaboration. They should be eager to learn about agile practice and be at ease with both written and verbal communication, especially informal collaboration.</p>

<h2>Team Committed to Agile Process</h2>

<h3>What</h3>

<p>The ServiceNow team uses agile methods to develop the product. In particular, the team develops in sprints - three week intervals, at the end of which a production-ready increment of the system is complete. This contrasts with more traditional development methods were many aspects of the system are developed in parallel and there is typically only one release.</p>

<p>This means the ServiceNow team will be revisiting, often repeatedly, the same process or component on every sprint - getting it "perfect" on the first go is the opposite of the objective.</p>

<p>In sprints where the ServiceNow team works on deliverables for your team, it is expected your whole team will attend and participate in the sprint reviews. At the end of each sprint, the ServiceNow team review, where they share out the work completed in the last sprint and the work being contemplated in the next.</p>

<h3>Why</h3>

<p>The biggest risk in software development is not buildings things too slowly or inefficiently, it's building the wrong things and having to replace them. Put differently, tt is better to have the imperfect <em>something</em>, than the ideal <em>nothing.</em></p>

<p>By participating in all of the ceremonies, your team reduces the risk of the project. What feels like costly meetings are valuable investments in the safety of your release.</p>

<h3>How</h3>

<p>Ensuring your team is encouraged to attend and accountable for participation.</p>
